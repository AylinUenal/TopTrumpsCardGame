## About

My first project during the Ironhack bootcamp was to build a card game from scratch within 4 days. I developed a top trumps card game with an animal card deck including functionalities like winning and losing messages as well as score keeping.

## Tech stack

The game is built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML using DOM manipulation.


## Functionalities

When you start the game, you and the computer as your opponent each get dealt a random card from the card deck of animals. From the categories on the animal card you choose the one you want to play with - either top speed, fear factor, cuteness, or life span.

Then, the opponent's card is revealed, the category you chose is highlighted and there is a message displaying whether you won or lost this round. Each round adds to the score of the winner. Also, there are sounds depending on the outcome of each round and the buttons clicked. Whoever is first to win 5 rounds is the winner of the game.
